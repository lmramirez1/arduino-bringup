# arduino-bringup

## overveiw
this repository documents my process of bringing up Arduino-based hardware systems, including wiring, firmware develeopment, debugging, and validation.

## Goals
- Practice hardware-software integration 
- Develop structured embedded C++ code
- Build and test repeatable robotic subsystems

## Hardware
- Arduino microcontroller
- Sensors and actuators

## Software
- Language: C++
- Development: Arduino IDE
- Version control: Git/Github

## Testing and validation 
Each experiment includes test notes documenting issues encountered, debugging steps, and final outcomes. 

## Status
Active development
